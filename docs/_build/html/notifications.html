<h1>Notifications Service<a class="headerlink" href="#notifications-service" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>FogLAMP supports an optional service, known as the notification service that adds an event engine to the FogLAMP installation. The notification services observed data as it flows into the FogLAMP storage service buffer and processes that data against a set of rules that are configurable by the user to determine if an event has occurred. Events may be either when a condition that was previously not met being is, or a condition that was previously met becoming no longer true. The notification service can then send a notification when an event occurs or, in the case of a condition that is met, it can send notifications as long as that condition is met.</p>
<p>The notification services operates on data that is in the storage layer, and is independent of the individual south services. This means that the notification rules can use data from several south services to evaluate if a condition has occurred. Also the data that is observed by the notification is after any filtering rules have been applied in the south services but before any filtering that occurs in the north tasks. The mechanism used to allow the notification service to observe data is that the notifications register with the storage service to be given the values for particular assets as they arrive at the storage service. A notification may register for several assets and is free to buffer that data internally within the notification service. This registration does not impact how the data that is requested is treated in the rest of the system; it will still for example follow the normal processing rules to be sent onward to the north systems.</p>
<div class="section" id="notifications">
<h2>Notifications<a class="headerlink" href="#notifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The notification services manages <em>Notifications</em>, these are a set of parameters that it uses to determine if an event has occurred and a notification delivery should be made on the basis of that event.</p>
<p>A notification within the notification service consists of;</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>A notification rule plugin that contains the logic to evaluate if a rule has been triggered, thus creating an event.</li>
<li>A set of assets that are required to execute a notification rule.</li>
<li>Information that defines how the data for each asset should be delivered to the notification rule.</li>
<li>Configuration for the rule plugin that customizes that logic to this notification instance.</li>
<li>A delivery plugin that provides the mechanism to delivery an event to destination for the notification.</li>
<li>Configuration that may be required for the delivery plugin to operate.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="section" id="notification-rules">
<h3>Notification Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#notification-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Notification rules are the logic that is used by the notification to determine if an event has occurred or not. An event is basically based on the values of a number of attributes, either at a single point in time or over a period of time. The notification services is delivered with one built in rule, this is a very simple rule called the <em>threshold rule</em> it simply looks at a single asset to determine if the value of a datapoint within the asset goes above or below a set value.</p>
<p>A notification rule has associated with it a set of configuration options, these define how the plugin behaves but also what data the plugin requires to execute the evaluation logic within the plugin. These configuration parameters can be divided into two sets; those items that define the data the rule requires from the notification service itself and those that relate directly to the logic of the rule.</p>
<p>A rule may work across one or more assets, the assets it requires are configured in the rule configuration and passed the the notification service to enable the service to subscribe to those assets and be sent that data by the storage service. A rule plugin may ask for every value of the asset as it changes or it may ask for a window of data. A window is defined as the values of an asset within a given time frame. An example might be the last 10 minutes of values. In the case of the window the rule may be passed the average value, minimum, maximum or all values in that window.  The requirements about how data is delivered to a rule may be hard coded within the logic of a rule or may be part of the configuration a user of the rule should provide.</p>
<p>The second type of configuration parameter a rule might include are those that control the logic itself, in the example of the <em>threshold rule</em> this would be the threshold value itself and the control if the event is considered to have triggered if the value is above or below the threshold.</p>
<p>The section <a href="foglamp_plugins.html#notification-rule-plugins">Notification Rule Plugins</a> contains a full list of currently available rule plugins for FogLAMP. As with other plugin types they are designed to be easily written by end users and developers, a guide is available for anyone wishing to write a notification rule plugin of their own.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notification-types">
<h3>Notification Types<a class="headerlink" href="#notification-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Notifications can be delivered under a number of different conditions based on the state returned from a notification rule and how it related to the previous state returned by the notification rule, this is known as the notification type. A notification may be one of three types, these types are used to define when and how often notification are delivered.</p>
<div class="section" id="one-shot">
<h4>One shot<a class="headerlink" href="#one-shot" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A one shot notification is sent once when the notification triggers but will not be resent again if the notification triggers on successive evaluations. Once the evaluation does not trigger, the notification is cleared and will be sent again the next time the notification rule triggers.</p>
<p>One shot notifications may be further tailored with a maximum repeat frequency, e.g. no more than once in any 15 minute period.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="toggle">
<h4>Toggle<a class="headerlink" href="#toggle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A toggle notification is sent when the notification rule triggers and will not be resent again until the rule fails to trigger, in exactly the same way as a one shot trigger. However in this case when the notification rule first stops triggering a cleared notification is sent.</p>
<p>Again this may be modified by the addition of a maximum repeat frequency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="retriggered">
<h4>Retriggered<a class="headerlink" href="#retriggered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A retriggered notification will continue to be sent when a notification rule triggers. The rate at which the notification is sent can be controlled by a maximum repeat frequency, e.g. send a notification every 5 minutes until the condition fails to trigger.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notification-delivery">
<h3>Notification Delivery<a class="headerlink" href="#notification-delivery" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The notification service does not natively support any form of notification delivery, it relies upon a notification delivery plugin in order to delivery a notification of an event to a user or external system that should be alerted to the event that has occurred. Typical notification deliveries might be to alert a user via some form of paging or messaging system, push an event to an external application by sending some machine level message, execute an external program or code segment to make an action occur, switching on an indication light or in extreme cases maybe shutting down a machine for which a critical fault has been detected. The section <a href="foglamp_plugins.html#notification-delivery-plugins">Notification Delivery Plugins</a> contains a full list of currently available notification delivery plugins, however like other plugins these are easily extended and a guide is available for writing notification plugins to extend the available set of plugins.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installing-the-notification-service">
<h2>Installing the Notification Service<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-the-notification-service" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The notification service is not part of the base FogLAMP installation and is not a plugin, it is a separate microservice dedicated to the detection of events and the sending of notifications. The service is stored in a separate source repository, <em>foglamp-service-notification</em> and is packaged as a separate binary package for installation.</p>
<div class="section" id="building-notification-service">
<h3>Building Notification Service<a class="headerlink" href="#building-notification-service" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As with <em>FogLAMP</em> itself there is always the option to build the notification service from the source code repository. This is only recommended if you also built your <em>FogLAMP</em> from source code, if you did not then you should first do this before building the notification, otherwise you should install a binary package of the notification service.</p>
<p>The steps involved in building the notification service, assuming you have already built FogLAMP itself and the environment variable <em>FOGLAMP_ROOT</em> points to where you built your <em>FogLAMP</em>, are;</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> git clone https://github.com/foglamp-iot/foglamp-service-notification.git
<span class="go">...</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> foglamp-service-notification
<span class="gp">$</span> ./requirements.sh
<span class="go">...</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> mkdir build
<span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> build
<span class="gp">$</span> cmake ..
<span class="go">...</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> make
<span class="go">...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will result in the creation of a notification service binary, you now need to copy that binary into the <em>FogLAMP</em> installation. There are two options here, one if you used <em>make install</em> to create your installation and the other if you are running directly form the build environment.</p>
<p>If you used <em>make install</em> to create your <em>FogLAMP</em> installation then simply run <em>make install</em> to install your notification service. This should be run from the <em>build</em> directory under the <em>foglamp-service-notification</em> directory.</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> make install
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">You may need to run <em>make install</em> under a sudo command if your user does not have permissions to write to the installation directory. If you use a DESTDIR=… option to the <em>make install</em> of <em>FogLAMP</em> then you should use the same DESTDIR=… option here also.</p>
</div>
<p>If you are running your <em>FogLAMP</em> directly from the build environment, then execute the command</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> cp ./C/services/notification/foglamp.services.notification <span class="nv">$FOGLAMP_ROOT</span>/services

</div>
<div class="section" id="installing-notification-service-package">
<h3>Installing Notification Service Package<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-notification-service-package" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you are using the packaged binaries for you system then you can use the package manager to install the <em>foglamp-service-notification</em> package. The exact command depends on your package manager and how you obtained your packages.</p>
<p>If you downloaded you packages then you should navigate to the directory that contains your package files and run the package manager. If you have deb package files run the command</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> sudo apt -y install ./foglamp-service-notification-1.7.0-armhf.deb

</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The version number, 1.7.0 may be different on your system, this will depend which version you have downloaded. Also the armhf may be different for your machine architecture. Verify the precise name of your package before running the above command.</p>
</div>
<p>If you are using a RedHat or CentOS distribution and have rpm package files then run the command</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> sudo yum -y localinstall ./foglamp-service-notification-1.7.0-x86_64.deb

<p>If you have configured your system to search a package repository that contains the FogLAMP packages then you can simply run the command</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> sudo apt-get -y install foglamp-service-notification
