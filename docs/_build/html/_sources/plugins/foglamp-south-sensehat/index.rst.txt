The *foglamp-south-sensehat* is a plugin that uses the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT sensor board. The Sense HAT has an 8Ã—8 RGB LED matrix, a five-button joystick and includes the following sensors:

  - Gyroscope

  - Accelerometer

  - Magnetometer

  - Temperature

  - Barometric pressure

  - Humidity

In addition it has an 8x8 matrix for RGB LED's, these are not included in the devices the plugin supports.

Individual sensors can be enabled or disabled separately in the configuration. Separate assets are created for each sensor within FogLAMP with individual controls over the naming of these assets.

.. note::

   The Sense HAT plugin is only available on the Raspberry Pi as it is specific the GPIO pins of that device.
